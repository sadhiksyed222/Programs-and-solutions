Reverse Even Integers
Author

The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print all the even integers among the N integers in reverse order as the output. If there is no even integer then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
1 2 5 7 8
Output:
8 2
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
1 3 5 7
Output:
-1
N = int(input())
numList = [int(val) for val in input().split()]
printed = False
for index in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    if numList[index] % 2 == 0:
        print(numList[index], end = " ")
        printed = True
if not printed:
    print("-1")
