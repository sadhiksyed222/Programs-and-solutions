A positive integer N is passed as the input. If we print all the numbers from 1 to N continuosly, the program must find the number of characters(digits) C printed and print the count C as the output.
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains C.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999999
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2
Output:
2
Explanation:
We print 12 and hence the total number of characters is 2.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
15
Output:
21
Explanation:
We print 123456789101112131415 and hence the total number of characters is 21.
n=int(input())
s=""
for i in range(1,n+1):
    s+=str(i)
print(len(s))
