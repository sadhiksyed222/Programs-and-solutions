Longest Set - Absolute Difference Less Than One
Author
letuscrack
An array of N integers is passed as input. The program must print the length of the longest set of integers among the N numbers so that the absolute difference between any two integers in the set does not exceed 1.
Input Format:
The first line will contain the value of N which represents the count of integers to be passed as input.
The second line will contain N integer value separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line will contain the integer value denoting the longest set of integers meeting the given criteria.
Constraints:
3 <= N <= 10000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
1 3 2 1 4 2 1 5 3
Output:
5
Explanation:
The longest set meeting the condition is {1,2,1,2,1}
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
1 2 3 4 5 3
Output:
3
Explanation:
The longest set meeting the condition is {3,4,3}
#include<stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int n, i, j, k, count[10000] = {0},max = 0;
  scanf("%d", & n);
  int a[n];
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d", & a[i]);
    count[a[i]]++;
  }
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (max < count[a[i]] + count[a[i] - 1])
      max = count[a[i]] + count[a[i] - 1];
      if (max < count[a[i]] + count[a[i] + 1])
      max = count[a[i]] + count[a[i] + 1];
  }
  printf("%d", max);

}
