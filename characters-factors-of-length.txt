Characters - Factors of Length
Author
letuscrack
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must calculate the length of string S as L. Then the program must print the characters which are present at the positions of the factors of L in ascending order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters based on the above conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack
Output:
sik
Explanation:
The length of the string "skillrack" is 9.
The factors of 9 are 1, 3 and 9.
So the characters present at the positions 1, 3 and 9 are printed.
Hence the output is sik
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
google
Output:
gooe
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char s[100];
    int length;
    scanf("%s",s);
    length=strlen(s);
    for(int i=1;i<=length;i++)
    {
        if(length%i==0)
        {
            printf("%c",s[i-1]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
