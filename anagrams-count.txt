letuscrack
Two strings S1, S2 are passed as input to the program. The program must print the count of anagrams present in both the strings. Out of each pair of words in the anagram the first word in the pair must be in S1 and the second word in the pair must be in S2.
If two words have the same characters and the occurrence number of each character is also identical respectively, they are anagrams.
Example:  silent & listen
Input Format:
The first line will contain the value of S1.
The first line will contain the value of S2.
Boundary Conditions:
Length of S1 and S2 is from 5 to 200.
Output Format:
The count of pair of anagrams in S1 and S2 based on the conditions mentioned.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
but i will not listen to him
water dropped into the silent tub
Output:
2
Explanation:
The anagram pairs are
but tub

s=input().split();a=[];l=[];c=0
d=input().split();b=[];m=[]
for i in s:a.append(sorted(i))
for i in a:
  k=''
  for j in i:k+=j
  l.append(k)
for i in d:b.append(sorted(i))
for i in b:
  p=''
  for j in i:p+=j
  m.append(p)
for i in l:
  if i in m:c+=1
print(c)
