Sum of Dice Values
Author
letuscrack
Pairs of integers are passed as the input to the program. The integers in each pair represent values of two dice in a game. If both the values are same, then the dice are rolled again. If the values are different, then the game ends. The program must print the sum of total number of values obtained from the dice at the end of the game.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Value of each integer <= 6
Input Format:
The lines contain two integers each separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of all values obtained from the dice.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 4
3 3
2 5
Output:
21
Explanation:
The dice are rolled until two different values are obtained.
So the total sum is 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 21
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 5
1 1
2 2
4 4
5 4
Output:
33
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int d1,d2,i,sum=0;
    for(i=0;;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d %d",&d1,&d2);
        sum=sum+(d1+d2);
        if(d1!=d2)break;
    }
    printf("%d",sum);
return 0;
}
