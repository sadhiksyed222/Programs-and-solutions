Author

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the pattern of (2*N)-1 lines based on the following conditions.
- Each row of the pattern contains N characters.
- In the 1st row, the Nth character is 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
- In the 2nd row, the Nth, (N-1)th characters are 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
- In the 3rd row, the Nth, (N-2)th characters are 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
- Similarly, the first N lines of the pattern are printed.
- In the (N+1)th row, the Nth, 2nd characters are 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
- In the (N+2)th row, the Nth, 3rd characters are 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
- Similarly, the remaining lines of the pattern are printed.
Note: All characters in each row must be separated by a space.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first (2*N)-1 lines containing the desired pattern as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
Output:
* * 0
* 0 0
0 * 0
* 0 0
* * 0
Explanation:
Here N = 3, so the pattern contains 5 lines ((2*3)-1).
In the 1st row, the 3rd character is 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
* * 0
In the 2nd row, the 3rd, 2nd characters are 0 and the remaining character is an asterisk.
* 0 0
In the 3rd row, the 3rd, 1st characters are 0 and the remaining character is an asterisk.
0 * 0
In the 4th row, the 3rd, 2nd characters are 0 and the remaining character is an asterisk.
* 0 0
In the 5th row, the 3rd character is 0 and the remaining characters are asterisks.
* * 0
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
Output:
* * * * 0
* * * 0 0
* * 0 * 0
* 0 * * 0
0 * * * 0
* 0 * * 0
* * 0 * 0
* * * 0 0
* * * * 0
