1 <= N <= 99999999
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains Yes or No.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
123
Output:
Yes

Output:
No
Explanation:
The sum of digits in  a given number is 1+2+3+3 = 9.
Hence the output is No.
n=input()
s=0
for i in n:
    s+=int(i)
print('Yes' if s%2==0 else print('No')
