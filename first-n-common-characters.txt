Author
letuscrack
Two string values S1, S2 are passed as the input. The program must print first N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.
Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.
The third line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.
Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 10

2 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcbde
cdefghbb
3
Output:
bcd
Note: b occurs twice in common but must be printed only once.
