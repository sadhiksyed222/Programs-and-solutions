Caesar Cipher

In Caesar cipher, each letter is replaced by another letter which occurs at the  d-th position (when counted from the position of the original letter),  in the  English alphabet.  For identifying the position of a letter, we follow the usual order of the English alphabet, from a to z. Given a word and a positive integer d, use Caesar cipher to encrypt it. For example, if the word is ‘ball’ and the value of ‘d’ is 3 then the new encrypted word is ‘edoo’. ‘x’ will be replaced by ‘a’, ‘y’ should be replaced by ‘b’ and ‘z’ should be replaced by ‘c’. While the code is submitted for Online Judge (SkillRack), use rstrip(), to remove carriage return character in the input.
Input Format
Word
A positive integer ‘d’
Output format:
Encrypted word

Input for the problem:
A word
An integer
Processing:
We use type conversion and addition along with the use of modulus to encrypt the given word.
Output :
Encrypted word
a=str(input())
b=""
a=a.rstrip();
d=int(input())
for i in a:
    n=ord(i)+d
    if(n>=122):
        n=n-26
    b=b+chr(n)
print(b)
