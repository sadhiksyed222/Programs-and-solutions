Expand alphabets occurrence
Author

A string consisting of short hand form of occurrence of alphabets will be passed as input. The program must expand the code and print the alphabets.
Input Format:
The first line will contain the short hand form of the code of length L.
Boundary Conditions:
2 <= L <= 20
Output Format:
The alphabets occurrence based on the short hand code.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
a3b5a2
Output:
aaabbbbbaa
Explanation:
a3 implies a has to occur 3 times and hence a is printed thrice.
b5 implies b has to be occur five times and hence b is printed five times.
a2 again implies a has to occur 2 times and hence a is printed thrice.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
z2m6c4
Output:
zzmmmmmmcccc
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
abc5
Output:
aaaaabbbbbccccc
Explanation:
Here there is no number after a and b. This implies the next immediate number of occurrence is applicable to both a and b.
Hence 5 which occurs after c is applicable to a and b too. So all the three alphabets a,b,c are printed five times.

                            st+=c[k];

                        }

                }

                System.out.print(st);

                    st="";

                }
              
        }
