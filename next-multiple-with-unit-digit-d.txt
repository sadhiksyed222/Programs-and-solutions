A positive integer N and a digit D are passed as input to the program. The program must print the first multiple of N (which is greater than N) which has the same unit digit as D.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 9999
0 <= D <= 9
Input Format:
The first line contains N and D separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integer value which is the first multiple of N which has the unit digit as D.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
24 2
Output:
72
Explanation:
24, 48, 72, 96, .. are multiples of 24.
The first multiple greater than N which has 2 as unit digit is 72 which is printed as the output.
 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
401 1
Output:
4411
n,d=map(int,input().split());i=n+n
while(n>0):
  if i%n==0 and i%10==d:
     print(i);break
  i+=n
