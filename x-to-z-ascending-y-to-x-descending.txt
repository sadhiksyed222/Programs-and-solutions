Three positive integers X, Y and Z are passed as the input to the program. The program must print from X to Z in the forward direction and then print from Y to X in the reverse direction.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X < Y < Z <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the values from X to Z separated by a space.
The second line contains the values from Y to X separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 10 15
Output:
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
10 9 8 7 6 5
 
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2 5 9
Output:
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5 4 3 2
x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
l=[];k=[]
l=[i for i in range(x,z+1)]
k=[i for i in range(y,x-1,-1)]
print(*l)
print(*k)
