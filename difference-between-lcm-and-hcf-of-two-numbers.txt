Two whole numbers N1 and N2 are passed as input. The program must print the difference between the LCM and HCF of these two numbers.
Input Format:
First line will contain the value of the first number N1
Second line will contain the value of the second number N2
Output Format:
First line will contain the difference between the LCM and HCF of N1 and N2
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N1 <= 99999
1 <= N2 <= 99999
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
30
45
Output:
75
Explanation:
LCM is 90 and HCF is 15. Difference = 90-15 = 75
Example 2:
Input:
100
120
Output:
580
Explanation:
LCM is 600 and HCF is 20. Difference = 600-20 = 580
from fractions import gcd
x,y=int(input()),int(input())
t=gcd(x,y)
l=x*y//t
print(l-t)
