C - Function - Reverse In Groups
Author
letuscrack
Given an array of integers of size N and size of group R as input, the program must reverse and print every R elements in the array. Please fill in the lines of code to define the method reverseInGroups so that the program runs successfully.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, R <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N and R separated by a space.
The second line contains N elements separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains N elements separated by space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 4
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Output:
40 30 20 10 80 70 60 50 90 100
Explanation:
Reverse the first 4 elments -> 40 30 20 10
Reverse the next 4 elements -> 80 70 60 50
At last only 2 elements left which less than 4 so keep as it is -> 90 100
Hence the output is 40 30 20 10 80 70 60 50 90 100
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7 8
2 4 6 8 10 12 14
Output:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14
Explanation:
The array has only 7 elements which is less than 8 so keep as it is -> 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
Hence the output is 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
