Python Program for Interlace odd / even from A to B
Author
letuscrack
Two numbers A and B are passed as input. The program must print the odd numbers from A to B (inclusive of A and B) interlaced with the even numbers from B to A.
Input Format:
The first line denotes the value of A.
The second line denotes the value of B.
Output Format:
The odd and even numbers interlaced, each separated by a space.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= A <= 9999999
A <  B <= 9999999
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
11
Output:
5 10 7 8 9 6 11
Explanation:
The odd numbers from 5 to 11 are 5 7 9 11
The even numbers from 11 to 5 (that is in reverse direction) are 10 8 6
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 5 10 7 8 9 6 11
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
14
Output:
14 5 12 7 10 9 8 11 6 13 4
Explanation:
The odd numbers from 4 to 14 are 5 7 9 11 13
The even numbers from 14 to 4 (that is in reverse direction) are 14 12 10 8 6 4
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 14 5 12 7 10 9 8 11 6 13 4
(Here as the even numbers count are more than the odd numbers count we start with the even number in the output)
Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3
12
Output:
3 12 5 10 7 8 9 6 11 4
Explanation:
The odd numbers from 3 to 12 are 3 5 7 9 11
The even numbers from 12 to 3 (that is in reverse direction) are 12 10 8 6 4
So these numbers are interlaced to produce 3 12 5 10 7 8 9 6 11 4
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
i=a;j=b
while(i<=b and j>=a):
    if i%2!=0:
        print(i,end=" ")
    i+=1
    if j%2==0:
        print(j,end=" ")
    j-=1
