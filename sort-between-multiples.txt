Sort Between Multiples: The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must sort the integers present between consecutive multiples of X in ascending order. Then the program must print the sorted integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, X <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains N integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7 2
2 5 3 12 13 9 8
Output:
2 3 5 12 9 13 8
Explanation:
The integers present between the multiples of 2 (2 and 12) are 5 and 3 which are sorted.
The Next set of integers present between the multiples of 2 (12 and 8) are 13 and 9 which are sorted.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 4
38 22 52 40 64 46 5 29 60 90
Output:
38 22 52 40 64 5 29 46 60 90
