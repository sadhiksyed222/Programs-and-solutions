Author

Six Blocks Two Towers: Accept an input of 6 numbers which represent the height of blocks. Also accept 2 numbers which represent the height of the towers. Use the blocks to get the desired height of the towers by using 3 blocks for each tower. The result for each tower should be printed in descending order of the height of the blocks.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Height of the blocks <= 1000
3 <= Height of the towers <= 3000
Input Format:
The first line contains the height of the six blocks separated by a space.
The second line contains the height of the two towers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the height of the blocks forming tower1 (separated by a space) and then an ampersand which is again followed by the height of the blocks forming tower2 (separated by a space).
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 15 90 65 30 25
135 100
Output:
90 30 15 & 65 25 10
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
45 30 12 18 10 40
40 115
Output:
18 12 10 & 45 40 30
