Two numbers X and Y are provided with reference to base N. Add the numbers and print their sum with reference to base 10.
Input Format: First line will contain the value of N. Second line will contain X and Y separated by one or more spaces.
Output Format: First line will contain the sum of X and Y to the base 10.
Boundary Conditions: 1 <= N <= 10
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2
1010 11
Output:
13
Explanation: 1010 to the base 2 is 10. 11 to the base 2 is 3. Hence the sum is 10+3 = 13.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
11 201
Output:
23
Explanation: 11 to the base 3 is 4. 201 to the base 3 is 19. Hence the sum is 23
n=int(input())
x,y=input().split()
print(int(x,n)+int(y,n))
