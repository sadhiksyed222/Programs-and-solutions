Filling Cans

Two cans are with capacity X and y liters.The program must determine the number of steps required to obtain exactly Z liters of liquid one of the cans.
At the beginning both the cans are empty.The following operations are countered as “steps”:
->emptying a vessel
->filling a vessel
->pouring liquid from larger can to the smaller, without spilling untill one of the cans is either full or empty.
If it is not possible to obtain Z liters exactly then the output must be -1.
Example 1:
Input:
5
2
3
Output:
2
Explanation:
Here X=5,Y=2
Step 1:Pour 5 liters of liquid into 5 liter can
step 2:Pour 2 liter from 5 liter can into 2 liter can
Now the 5 liter can will have 3 liter which is Z.Hence 2 steps are required.
Example 2:
Input:
2
3
4
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Z is greater than X and Y.Hence it is not possible to have 4 liters in any one of the cans.Hence output is -1.
