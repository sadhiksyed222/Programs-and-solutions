The arrival time in HH:MM format of those who attended the meeting is passed as the input in a single line, with each arrival time by a space. The program must print the count of people who came late (after 10:00 am) to the meeting.
Input Format:
The first line contains the arrival time separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of late comers.
Boundary Conditions:
The length of the input string is between 4 to 10000.
The time HH:MM will be in 24 hour format (HH is hours and MM is minutes).
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10:00 9:55 10:02 9:45 11:00
Output:
2
Explanation:
The 2 people were those who came at 10:02 and 11:00
l=[i.split(":") for i in input().split()]
c=0
for i in l:
    if int(i[0])>10 or int(i[0])==10 and int(i[1])>0:
        c+=1
print(c)
