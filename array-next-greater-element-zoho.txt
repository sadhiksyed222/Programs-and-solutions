Author
letuscrack
Given an array of positive integers, print the next greater element for every element in the Array.
The next greater element for a given element X is the first greater element on the right side of X in the Array. If the element X does not have a greater element, print -1 for X.
Input Format:
The first line contains N, which denotes the number of elements in the Array.
The second line contains N positive integers, each separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the N integers which represent the next greater elements, each separated by a space.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 10000
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
4 5 2 25
Output:
5 25 25 -1
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
10 9 8 7 6
Output:
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
