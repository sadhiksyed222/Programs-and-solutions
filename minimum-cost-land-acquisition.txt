Minimum Cost - Land Acquisition: The government of India plans to build a road In a city. The government also plans to acquire some lands to start the construction. The program must accept an Integer matrix of size N*N representing the heights of the buildings (i.e., the number of storeys In each building) in the city. A positive value X in the matrix indicates that there is an X-storey building. A zero value in the matrix indicates the presence of land that cannot be acquired by the government. 
The rules for road construction In the city are given below.
- The road always starts from the first row and ends at the last row. 
- No more than one building In a row can be acquired by the government. 
The cost to acquire an X-storey building is X. The government has decided to acquire the lands with the minimum cost M. The program must print the minimum cost M to acquire land for road construction in the given city as the output. 
NOTE: It is always possible to build a road In the given city.
Input Format: 
The first line contains N. 
The next N lines, each contains N Integers separated by space. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains M.
