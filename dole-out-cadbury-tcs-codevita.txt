Dole Out Cadbury – TCS CodeVita
Author

In a school, a teacher is assigned to distribute the Cadbury to the students for Independence Day. The teacher has a box full of Cadbury with different width and height. He can only distribute the largest square shape Cadbury. So if he has a Cadbury of length 10 and width 5, then he needs to break the Cadbury in 5x5 square and distribute to the first student and then the remaining 5x5 square to the next student in the queue. The program must accept four integers P, Q, R and S representing the minimum length, maximum length, minimum width and maximum width of Cadbury in the box as the input. The program must print the total number of students who will get the Cadbury as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= P < Q <= 1500
1 <= R < S <= 1500
Input Format:
The first line contains P, Q, R and S separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the total number of students who will get the Cadbury.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 6 3 4
Output:
14
Explanation:
There are four possible sizes of Cadbury.
5x3, 5x4, 6x3 and 6x4.
The size of the first Cadbury is 5x3.
The first student gets 3x3. The size of the remaining Cadbury is 2x3.
The next student gets 2x2. The size of the remaining Cadbury is 2x1.
The next two students get 1x1 each.
So 4 students can get the Cadbury from the 5x3 Cadbury.
The size of the second Cadbury is 5x4.
The first student gets 4x4. The size of the remaining Cadbury is 1x4.
The next four students get 1x1 each.
So 5 students can get the Cadbury from the 5x4 Cadbury.
The size of the third Cadbury is 6x3.
The first two students get 3x3 each.
So 2 students can get the Cadbury from the 6x3 Cadbury.
The size of the fourth Cadbury is 6x4.
The first student gets 4x4. The size of the remaining Cadbury is 2x4.
The next two students get 2x2 each.
So 3 students can get the Cadbury from the 6x4 Cadbury.
Hence 14 students can get the Cadbury from the box. So 14 is printed as the output.
