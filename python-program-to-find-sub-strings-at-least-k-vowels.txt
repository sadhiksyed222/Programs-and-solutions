Python Program To Find Sub-strings at least K vowels
Author
letuscrack
A string S of length L and an integer K is passed as the input. The program must sort and print the count of all the unique sub-strings (with a given combination of characters) containing at least K vowels. Then the program must also print those sub-strings in sorted order.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= L <= 25
K <= L
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains K.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integer value C representing the count.
Next C lines contain the sub-string values.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
apple
2
Output:
8
ae
ale
ape
aple
appe
apple
Explanation:
These 8 sub-strings contain at least 2 vowels (As K=2).
ela and eal are not printed as ale contains the combination of these characters.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
management
4
Output:
64
