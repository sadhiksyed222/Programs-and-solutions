Inviting Customer Count: A company plans a viral marketing strategy in which an existing customer will invite N other new customers every day for D days. At the end of the Dth day, a customer will get a gift and must leave (the left customers will not invite any new customers on D+1 th day). A customer who has got a gift and left will not be invited again. On Day 1 there will be only one customer to begin with and this customer will leave at the end of the Dth day. Given N and D, the program must calculate the number of customers who are eligible to invite new customers on the Tth day.
Input Format:
The first line will contain N and D separated by a space.
The second line will contain T.
Output Format:
The first line will contain the number of customers who are eligible to invite new customers on the Tth day
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 5
1 <= D <= 10
1 <= T <= 50
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2 6
3
Output:
9
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2 6
7
Output:
726
Explanation:
Customers remaining at the end of day 1 is = 3
Customers remaining at the end of day 2 is = 9
Customers remaining at the end of day 3 is = 27
Customers remaining at the end of day 4 is = 81
Customers remaining at the end of day 5 is = 243
Customers remaining at the end of day 6 is = 726 (3 leave)
So customers who can invite on 7th day = 726
