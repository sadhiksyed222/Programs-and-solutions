Forest Fire - TCS CodeVita

Roco is an island near Africa which is very prone to forest fire. Forest fire is such that it destroys the complete forest. Not a single tree is left. This island has been cursed by God, and the curse is that whenever a tree catches fire, it passes the fire to all its adjacent tree in all 8 directions, North, South, East, West, North-East, North-West, South-East, and South-West. And it is given that the fire is spreading every minute in the given manner, i.e., every tree is passing fire to its adjacent tree. Suppose that the forest layout is as follows where T denotes tree and W denotes water.
W W T W W
W W T T W
W T T T W
T T W W T
W W W T W
If suppose the tree that catches the fire is at (3,3), then the fire from (3,3) will be passed on to (2,3), (3,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,4), which will happen in the second minute.
The tree in the fire in the first minute is highlighted below.

From the above forest layout, you can see the whole forest on fire in the fourth minute.
Your task is that given the location of the first tree that catches fire, determine how long would it take for the entire forest to be on fire. You may assume that the layout of the forest is such that the whole forest will catch fire for sure and that there will be at least one tree in the forest.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= M, N <= 20
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers(M and N separated by a space) representing the size of forest in terms of the number of rows and columns respectively.
The second line contains two integers(X and Y separated by a space) representing the coordinates of the first tree that catches fire.
The next M lines, each contains N characters separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the number of minutes taken for the entire forest to catch fire.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 3
1 3
W T T
T W W
W T T
Output:
5
Explanation:
Here X = 1 and Y = 3.
In the first minute, tree at (1, 3) catches fire.
In the second minute, tree at (1, 2) catches fire.
In the third minute, the tree at (2, 1) catches fire.
In the fourth minute, the tree at (3, 2) catches fire.
In the fifth minute, the last tree at (3, 3) catches fire.
So it takes 5 minutes for the entire forest to catch fire.
Hence the output is 5
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 6
1 6
W T T T T T
T W W W W W
