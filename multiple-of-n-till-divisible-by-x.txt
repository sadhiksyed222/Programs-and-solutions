Two numbers N and X are passed as input. The program must print the multiples of N (starting from 1) and must stop when the multiple is divisible by X.
Input Format:
The first line denotes the value of N.
The second line denotes the value of X.
Output Format:
The multiples of N, each separated by a space.
Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999
1 <= X <= 999999
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
8
Output:
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40
Explanation:
When 40 is reached, as 40 is divisible by 8, we stop the program execution.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
12
22
Output:
12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
k=a 
while(a>0):
    if k%b==0:
        print(k,end=" ")
        break
    else:
        print(k,end=" ")
        k+=a
