K Alphabets in Reverse Order
Author
letuscrack
The program must accept a lowercase alphabet ch and an integer K as the input. The program must print K alphabets from ch in reverse order.
Note: If K alphabets are not available from ch then print only available alphabets in reverse order.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= 26
Input Format:
The first line contains ch and K separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains alphabets as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
a 4
Output:
dcba
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
x 5
Output:
zyx
Explanation:
There are only three alphabets available from x (including x).
Hence those three alphabets are printed in reverse order.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
int num;
char alpha;

scanf("%c %d",&alpha,&num);


for(int i=alpha+num-1;i>=alpha;i--){
if(i<=122 && i>=97)
printf("%c",i);
}

}
