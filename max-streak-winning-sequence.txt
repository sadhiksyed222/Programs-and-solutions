Alok is playing N round of card games with his friend Brinda. He gets postive or negative points based on whether he won or lost in a specific round. Alok can also get zero points in case of a tie. Given the points obtained in N rounds, the program must print the maximum sum of points obtained in any of the winning streak sequence.
Input Format:
The first line contains N. The second line contains the points P(i), i=1 to N with the points separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains M which represents the maximum number of points obtained in any of the winning sequence.
Boundary Conditions:
3 <= N <= 100
-100 <= P(i) <= 100
Example Input/Output 1: Input:
7 9 2 3 -1 1 2 4
Output:
14
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
15 11 20 6 7 -4 2 -5 15 8 3 16 8 3 -1 -2
Output:
53
